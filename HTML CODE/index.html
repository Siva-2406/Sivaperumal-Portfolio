    <p>Freshworks STS Software Academy (FSSA) is a social impact initiative powered by Freshworks Technologies Pvt Ltd (popularly known as Freshworks) for students from low income families who are unable to afford conventional college education but have the right motivation, aptitude to learn software skills & have a strong desire to start their career in technology.

        So if you are someone who has the vigour to learn but does not have the means to afford it, then this program is for you.
        
        about
        Our Philosophy
        
        Freshworks is a place where skill & craftsmanship is celebrated over College degrees & pedigree. As an organization, what we understand and do best is build high quality softwares. We decided to teach this skill to the underserved community. Thereby give an opportunity to deserving young adults (18-21 year olds) who are unable to pursue higher education after 12th Grade from really low income families. What if this skill gets them
        
        a job, lifts them & their families permanently out of generational poverty cycles? Thus was born our flagship social impact program - Freshworks STS Software Academy (FSSA).
        
         
        
        What does the ‚ÄúSTS‚Äù in our name stand for?
        
         
        
        Mr. STS Prasad was our Senior Vice President who unfortunately is not with us anymore. In honour of him and as a tribute to his contribution in making the Academy a reality, Girish, our CEO, wanted to name the Academy after him. We believe our very own Siripurapu Taraka Subramanya (STS) Prasad will live through the Academy and its legacy.</p>
